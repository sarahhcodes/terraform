You are an astronaut, or perhaps a hazmat worker, and you are tasked with beautifying a barren landscape. The atmosphere is stable (even if you can't breathe it). The soil is clean. All you need to do at this point is plant and wait for the seedlings to grow.

Maybe one day, as the result of your efforts, you'll be able to take off your helmet and breathe the air. (That's for a future project though.)

Terraform is a tiny game inspired in one part by flash mini games of the 2000s and in one part 2010s and 2020s 
Mars landing futurism.
